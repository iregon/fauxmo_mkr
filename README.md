[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/iregon/fauxmo_mkr1010.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/iregon/fauxmo_mkr1010)

Amazon Alexa support for Arduino MKR 1010.

This is a library for Arduino MKR 1010 and Arduino WiFi devices that emulates Philips Hue lights and thus allows you to control them using this protocol, in particular from Alexa-powered devices like the Amazon Echo or the Dot.
