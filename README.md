# FauxmoMKR
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/iregon/fauxmo_mkr1010.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/iregon/fauxmo_mkr1010)

Amazon Alexa support for Arduino MKR 1010.

This is a library for Arduino MKR 1010 and Arduino WiFi devices that emulates Philips Hue lights and thus allows you to control them using this protocol, in particular from Alexa-powered devices like the Amazon Echo or the Dot.

## Usage

The library is very easy to use, basically instantiate an object, connect to the Wifi, add one or more virtual devices and bind the callback to get the messages. An schematic example could be:

```cpp
#include <fauxmoMKR.h>

fauxmoMKR fauxmo;

void setup() {

    Serial.begin(115200);

    ... connect to wifi ...

    fauxmo.addDevice("light one");
    fauxmo.addDevice("light two");
    fauxmo.addDevice("light three");
    fauxmo.addDevice("light four");

    fauxmo.setPort(80); // required for gen3 devices
    fauxmo.enable(true);

    fauxmo.onSetState([](unsigned char device_id, const char * device_name, bool state, unsigned char value) {
        Serial.printf("[MAIN] Device #%d (%s) state: %s value: %d\n", device_id, device_name, state ? "ON" : "OFF", value);
    });

}

void loop() {
    fauxmo.handle();
}

```

Then run the "discover devices" option from your Alexa app or web (in the Smart Home section). A new device with the name you have configured should appear. Tell Alexa to switch it on or off and check your terminal ;)
